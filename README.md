## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it? I got the tests to pass and the page to look right, but every time I would hit the 'Go!' button, the screen would reset back to the welcome screen. I've tried mutiple attempts of debugging through various methods-commenting out methods or adding new methods, that failed to fix the issue. Also, while the tests did pass, there was multiple errors about an element not being visible and the message: "A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --runInBand --detectOpenHandles to find leaks." Even my step-father, who has knowledge of progamming languages, was stumped on solving the issue. I hope that by turning it in, I can get answers on what happened.


### How long it took us to finish this?
